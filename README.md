Survey about Asynchronous Video Interviews

This is a project where i did the statistical analysis for a clients thesis in managment and business administration. The survey was created by the client and was sent to people who are currently looking for a job. The data was translated into english by me. Part of the content is what the client requested. The survey was conducted using google forms, so my job was to provide additional information, rather than just have the standard insights that google provides by default.
The base of this case study is to see if there is any correlation between the following categories: "Have you previously given an asynchronous video interview to an organization?", "Perceived_Ease_of_Use", "Perceived_Usefulness", "General_Attractiveness", "Behavioural_Intentions", "Prestige". Of course correlation does not mean causation!

This analysis contains the following steps:
-Process dataframe
-Generalize dataframe
-Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient
-Finding Correlations
-Function to calculate p-value from pearson correlation table
-Function that filters values in dataframe based on condition
-Checking correlations statistical importance using p-value
-Displaying the important correlations
-Confidence Interval for Correlation
--- Step 1: Create functions
