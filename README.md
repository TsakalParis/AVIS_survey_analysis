# AVIS Survey Analysis

A comprehensive statistical analysis of Asynchronous Video Interviews (AVI) survey data focusing on user perceptions and behavioral intentions.

## üìä Overview

This is a project where I did the statistical analysis for a client's thesis in management and business administration. The survey was created by the client and was sent to people who are currently looking for a job. The data was translated into English by me. Part of the content is what the client requested. The survey was conducted using Google Forms, so my job was to provide additional information, rather than just have the standard insights that Google provides by default.

The base of this case study is to see if there is any correlation between the following categories:
- "Have you previously given an asynchronous video interview to an organization?"
- "Perceived_Ease_of_Use"
- "Perceived_Usefulness" 
- "General_Attractiveness"
- "Behavioural_Intentions"
- "Prestige"

**Of course correlation does not mean causation!**

## üîç Analysis Methodology

The analysis follows a systematic approach to extract meaningful insights from survey data:

### Data Processing
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Variable transformation and encoding
- Generalization of dataset for analysis

### Statistical Reliability
- Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for each scale
- Internal consistency validation of measurement instruments

### Correlation Analysis
- Pearson correlation calculations
- P-value determination for statistical significance
- Identification of significant correlations
- Confidence intervals for correlations

### Descriptive Statistics
- Central tendency measures (mean, median, mode)
- Dispersion measures (standard deviation, variance)
- Coefficient of variation
- Confidence intervals for means
- Distribution analysis (skewness, kurtosis, IQR)

### Data Visualization
- Correlation heatmaps
- Histograms with density plots
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Violin plots for distribution comparison

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Variable Constructs

The analysis focuses on these key constructs:

- **Perceived Ease of Use**: User-friendliness of asynchronous video interviews
- **Perceived Usefulness**: Practical benefits of the interview format
- **General Attractiveness**: Overall appeal of organizations using this format
- **Behavioral Intentions**: Future actions regarding organizations using AVIs
- **Prestige**: Perceived status of organizations using this interview format

### Statistical Methods

- **Cronbach's Alpha**: Measures internal consistency of survey items
- **Pearson Correlation**: Quantifies relationships between variables
- **Fisher's Z Transformation**: Creates confidence intervals for correlations
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes central tendency and dispersion
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examines normality and shape of data distributions

This analysis provides correlational evidence only. As noted in the project description, correlation does not imply causation. The findings should be interpreted with appropriate caution when making business decisions.
